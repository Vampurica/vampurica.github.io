# Aura of Command (1)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Ventrue](../Clans/Ventrue))

While Dominate and Presence are a Ventrue's most reliable tools for manipulating mortal affairs and assembling their empire, a Ventrue with Aura of Command is not merely reliable, but unassailable. When targeting a mortal or ghoul with Dominate or Presence powers or techniques, her attack automatically succeeds as her opponent is unable to even assemble a test pool against her.
