# Arcane(1)

### General Merit

A character with Arcane is shrouded by a mystical essence which makes her difficult to remember. This has no effect on other characters' familiarity with her, nor does it affect how powers work on her, for example, Auspex powers function normally and do not read any differently than they otherwise would on a character without Arcane. However, people who meet her in passing will have a hard time recalling their encounter, and records of her interactions will disappear without a trace, both physical and digital. This lend her an easier time blending in, getting gossip and snooping around, but that same effect can be an annoyance when she wishes to provide an alibi.
