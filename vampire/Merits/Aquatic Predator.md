# Aquatic Predator (1)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Gangrel Noiad](<../Clans/Noiad>))

Through her connection with the water, a Noiad with Aquatic Predator who uses the Protean power Shape of the Beast may choose among her fight and flight forms as normal as well as a new form: her swim form. Her swim form takes the shape of an aquatic animal of her choosing and it gains the aquatic template for free. If she has wits-focus, she may also assign another template to this shape, in addition to aquatic.
