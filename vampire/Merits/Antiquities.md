# Antiquities (1)

### Restriction: Sect Specific (Camarilla)

It is only natural for a Camarilla member to acquire a veritable trove of ancient oddities. Perhaps she was interested in them for their historical value, perhaps she inherited them from a fellow Kindred who met an untimely final death or perhaps she simply acquired them way back when they were still new. Whatever the reason, whatever the job, she has access to the tool for the task from "back in the day". She may spend 1 downtime action to add the antique quality to any piece of non-combat equipment, which does not count against that piece's maximum quality count. While impressive, openly flaunting this collection may attract attention, good and bad, from other Kindred and mortals alike.
