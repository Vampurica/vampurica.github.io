# Addictive Blood (3)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Followers of Set](<../Clans/Followers of Set>))

Anyone who drinks from a Settite with Addictive Blood cannot turn down an opportunity to drink more without spending 1 willpower to do so. Spending willpower in this way allows her to resist her addiction for the next ten minutes. After five consequitive times spending willpower to do so, she breaks her addiction. If the Settite has the Presence power of Entrancement, anyone who drinks her blood automatically is affected by the effects of Entracement for the rest of the night.
