# Arcane Branding (1)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Gargoyle](<../Clans/Gargoyle>))

Originally a modification to the Gargoyle ritual to make better combattants for the Omen War, some Gargoyles are given a branding of runes which offer protection against magic. These runes give such a Gargoyle the effects of the Magic Resistance Merit, except for when she is attempting to defend against blood magic specifically cast by a Tremere (including Tremere Telyav). This Merit cannot be paired with the Magic Resistance Merit.
