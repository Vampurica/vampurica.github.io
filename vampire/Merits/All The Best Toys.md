# All The Best Toys (2)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Gangrel Anda](<../Clans/Anda>))

An Anda with All The Best Toys has embraced her heritage as a master of mounted combat. As a result, she receives a refund for xp and free points allocated to the Drive skill and may reassign them. Xp refunded in this manner is subject to spending restrictions such as having to spend downtime actions to increase a skill level by more than one during a downtime cycle. Any pre-existing dots in the Drive skill are removed and you then gain 5 dots in the Drive skill, which are tied to this Merit. If a character loses this Merit, then she also loses these dots in the Drive skill.

An Anda with All The Best Toys is also a master of vehicle procurement. She is able to acquire a vehicle worth $30,000 or less with a single downtime action, and may overtax her resources and/or spend additional downtime actions to acquire an even more expensive vehicle. This vehicle is not limited to land, allowing boats and planes to be purchased in addition to cars, motorcycles and mounts such as horses. Storytellers have the final say as to what counts as a vehicle which can be purchased using All The Best Toys. This means that vehicles not easily available for purchase, such as tanks, fighter jets or mythical creature mounts are probably not suitable for purchase using All The Best Toys.

Vehicles purchased through All The Best Toys are not unique. Therefore, the Anda may not purchase Air Force One or another player or npc's vehicle using this Merit, as these are specific and unique vehicles. When the Anda acquires vehicles, she does so through questionable means, so the vehicles are missing the appropriate registrations to stand up to scrutiny unless she spends resources worth at least half the vehicle's cost to acquire (or forge) the appropriate paperwork.
