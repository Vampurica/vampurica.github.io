# Angelic Visage (1)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Lasombra](<../Clans/Lasombra>))

Angelic Visage combines two of the premere distinctions of Clan Lasombra: shadow and grace. A Lasombra with Angelic Visage always has her face perfectly framed by light and shadow to cast a beautiful, compelling visage. She may take either the appearance or charisma social focus in addition to the social focus that she chooses during character creation.

She will always appear dignified and radiant, even when dirty, injured or at low humanity (or appearing to be at low humanity from a path of enlightenment). Note that at low humanity, her appearance will still change, however instead of appearing beastly, she will take on a serene, alien visage.
