# Ardent Companion (3)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Nosferatu](../Clans/Nosferatu))

It's rare that a Nosferatu makes a friend she can speak to face-to-face without even a hint of judgement or disgust, but this little fellow just happens to fit that description. Perhaps they're a rat that she met in the sewers, perhaps they're doberman of her last prey, perhaps they're a crocodile from the zoo, who's just as fed up with being looked at funny. She may build this companion for free as a ghouled animal retainer with a starting rating of 7. Adding additional rating to this companion costs like normal.
