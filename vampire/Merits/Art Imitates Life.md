# Art Imitates Life (3)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Gargoyle](../Clans/Gargoyle))

While a Gargoyle's stony features can often be a detriment, being an open breach of the Masquerade, for a Gargoyle with Art Imitates Life, her chiseled appearance is so striking that the benefits can far outweigh the drawbacks. She gains the appearance focus for her social attribute and may pick one of the following two features, which cannot be changed:

Angelic - An angelic Gargoyle's appearance is beautiful and commanding, granting her a +1 wildcard bonus to any attack test pool using her leadership skill. Her leadership skill's xp multiplier is treated as x1 for the purposes of increasing the skill's rating, allowing her to do so at Neonate costs.

Grotesque - A grotesque Gargoyle's appearance is appalling and horrific, granting her a +1 wildcard bonus to any attack test pool using her intimidation skill. Her intimidation skill's xp multiplier is treated as x1 for the purposes of increasing the skill's rating, allowing her to do so at Neonate costs.
