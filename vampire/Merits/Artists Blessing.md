# Artist's Blessing (1)

### Restriction: Clan Specific ([Toreador](../Clans/Toreador))

What is a Toreador without her art? It is only natural that many Toreador have honed their craft beyond the limits of mortal comprehension. A Toreador with Artist's Blessing increases the maximum rating of all of her craft and performance skills by 2 (generally summing to a maximum of 7). She also gains 3 free points to spend on the first 3 levels of any one craft or performance skill of her choice, refunding any xp for those levels if applicable. Xp refunded in this way may be immedeatly reassigned to a skill in which she has no points assigned.
