# Merits

Merits are transformational perks that enhance a character's stats, unlock additional active and passive effects and generally allow a player to fine-tune her character to better mechanically align with the character's concept and backstory.

By default, a character's Merit capacity is 7 points (note many Merits cost more than one point) however this limit increases by 1 for every grad that her player has, up to a maximum of 10 points.

A character is not required to begin play with her entire Merit capacity depleted. If a character has unspent Merit capacity, she may file downtime actions to purchase additional Merits, but never exceeding her capacity. Purchasing a Merit requires spending 1 XP per that Merit's level. Some Merits can only be purchased at character-creation, and may not be purchased this way.
