# Ananke
    #### Seers, Lunatics, Malks, Children of Malkav

Where standard Malkavians may have visions of the future in the literal sense, or be visited in their dreams, the Ananke bloodline relies on inspection of the dead, Haruspexy, in order to predict the future. Where standard Malkavians may prefer to stay out of the light, Ananke are fine with taking center stage to perform the rituals to bring them the truth they are seeking. Given the connection to death, Ananke are able to get access to Necromantic powers from their studies as well.

# In Clan Disciplines

[Auspex](../Disciplines/Auspex) — [Dementation](<../Disciplines/Dementation>) — [Presence](<../Disciplines/Presence>)

# Weakness

All Malkavians suffer from a permanent incurable [Derangement](../Flaws/Derangement). They may gain and cure other Derangements, but they can never remove their primary Derangement. This Derangement does not count for Flaw XP. A Malkavian's Derangement Traits can only ever be lowered to 1, and never reaches 0.

Additionally, Ananke compulsively take trophies of their activities. If their collection of trophies is threatened, stolen, or destroyed, they cannot regain Willpower until they have started a new collection.
