# Malkavians
    #### Seers, Lunatics, Malks, Children of Malkav

Malkavians are known for their mental powers and derangements, being inflicted with both the gifts and the insanity of their clan progenitor, Malkav. Legends say that Malkav was a Seer who was granted unlife before ultimately being ambushed and killed by his peers.

Most Malkavians have powers to see things that others cannot, and a few can see glimpses of the future, but their mental issues typically make them frustratingly unreliable to those who cannot relate to them. There is a mystical connection between all Malkavians normally referred to as the "Madness Network", or simply the "Network", which appears to be able to send all kinds of information between clan members. Some rumors claim that this network is actually what remains of Malkav themselves.

In modern nights, the Malkavians have positioned themselves as one of the pillar clans of the Camarilla, working alongside Clan [Ventrue](<./Ventrue>) to direct it with their prophesies and supernatural sight.

# Weakness

All Malkavians suffer from a permanent incurable [Derangement](../Flaws/Derangement). They may gain and cure other Derangements, but they can never remove their primary Derangement. This Derangement does not count for Flaw XP. A Malkavian's Derangement Traits can only ever be lowered to 1, and never reaches 0.
