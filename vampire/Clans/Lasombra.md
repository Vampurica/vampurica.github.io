# Lasombra
    #### Shadows, Magisters, The Night Clan

The Lasombra are one of the original vampire clans, known for their ruthless might-makes-right attitude, and their unique ability to manipulate shadows from their connection to the abyss. There are not many details about the creation of clan Lasombra other than their progenitor always being close to darkness, reveling in the biblical great flood, and joining with the other progenitors when the flood waters receded. Many Lasombra today still feel connected in some ways to the dark inky blackness of the deep.

It is well known that the Lasombra and the [Ventrue](./Ventrue) have held a strong rivalry with each other even since the early times. The Ventrue consider themselves to be the natural leaders of the vampire world, and enjoy the throne, but Lasombra are the opposite side of this coin, choosing to be the puppet-master from the shadows. While the Ventrue have lead the Camarilla to influence vampire society, the Lasombra were one of the two founding clans of the Sabbat, and have lead it in similar ways.

In recent nights, many Lasombra have found reason to abandon the Sabbat, and a few are making their way into the Camarilla or other sects, generally at heavy costs.

# Weakness

The presence of a Lasombra cannot be captured by technology nor by mirrors. Their reflections do not appear in mirrors or other reflective surfaces, touch screens do not react to them, their voice cannot be recorded, and so on.
