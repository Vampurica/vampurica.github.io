# Kiasyd
    #### Weirdlings, Broken Butterflies

Whether you believe that the Kiasyd were made by the embracing of a Fae, or by some sort of accident, what is clear is that this bloodline has strong ties to the faeries while still being very similar to their parent clan. The Kiasyd find themselves fascinated with ancient lore, and have access to knowledge that allows them to confound the minds of others in ways only the faeries understand.

Kiasyd are a bloodline that require 4 merit points to play.

# Weakness

The presence of a Lasombra cannot be captured by technology nor by mirrors. Their reflections do not appear in mirrors or other reflective surfaces, touch screens do not react to them, their voice cannot be recorded, and so on.

Additionally, a Kiasyd is unusually tall with chalky white skin and entirely black eyes.
