# Knights of the Moon
    #### Seers, Lunatics, Malks, Kooks, Carriers

In the 1400s when the Camarilla was first forming, the Malkavians were afraid of revealing their true power of madness to the other founding clans. They were concerned that if the others knew just how mad they were, and how they could inflict it onto others, that they would be removed from the signing of the Treaty of Thorns. To remedy this, a group of ancient Malkavians came together and performed what was called the "Great Prank", replacing their distinct powers of [Dementation](<../Disciplines/Dementation>) with the more common mental powers of [Dominate](<../Disciplines/Dominate>). This allowed them to get into the Camarilla without question and was a secret of the clan for some time.

For unknown reasons, the effects of the Great Prank began to wear off over time. It is uncertain if this was intentional or not, but newly embraced Malkavians began to gain access to the powers of old within the clan once more. However, this has not applied to the entirety of the clan, and the Knights of the Moon bloodline is evidence of this. Knights of the Moon are Malkavians who are still Carriers the discipline of [Dominate](<../Disciplines/Dominate>), and it has made some of them excellent in dealing with troublesome clan mates who are unprepared.

Knights of the Moon do not typically differentiate themselves from the main body of the clan, although they are represented as a separate bloodline.

Knights of the Moon are a bloodline that require 2 merit points to play.

# In Clan Disciplines

[Auspex](../Disciplines/Auspex) — [Dominate](<../Disciplines/Dominate>) — [Obfuscate](<../Disciplines/Obfuscate>)

# Weakness

All Malkavians suffer from a permanent incurable [Derangement](../Flaws/Derangement). They may gain and cure other Derangements, but they can never remove their primary Derangement. This Derangement does not count for Flaw XP. A Malkavian's Derangement Traits can only ever be lowered to 1, and never reaches 0.
