# Corsairs
    #### Pirates, Kraken, Seafarers

The Corsairs are a bloodline of Lasombra who have defected from the normalcy of their parent clan and embraced the sea. Most Corsairs took to the seas of the new world when the opportunity arose, often leading unlives of bloody piracy to great success. Where the traditional Lasombra prefer to stick to the shadows, the Corsairs prefer to lead viciously from the frontlines in the midst of combat.

When the greater Lasombra clan made their way to the new world, they initially clashed with the Corsairs before resolving to allow them to integrate back into the clan. Some say that this was due to the deep purses and influence however.

Corsairs are a bloodline that require 2 merit points to play.

# In Clan Disciplines

[Celerity](../Disciplines/Celerity) — [Obtenebration](<../Disciplines/Obtenebration>) — [Presence](<../Disciplines/Presence>)

# Weakness

The presence of a Lasombra cannot be captured by technology nor by mirrors. Their reflections do not appear in mirrors or other reflective surfaces, touch screens do not react to them, their voice cannot be recorded, and so on.

Additionally, Corsairs are risk takers who will never back down from slim chances. They suffer from the [Overconfident](<../Flaws/Overconfident>) Flaw and can never remove it.
